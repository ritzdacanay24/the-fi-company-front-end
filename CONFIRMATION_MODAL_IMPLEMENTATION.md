# Confirmation Modal Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive confirmation modal that displays a complete summary of all workflow information before final submission.

## Implementation Date
October 17, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Modal State Management**
- Added `showConfirmationModal` boolean flag
- Added `confirmationSummary` object to store all workflow data

### 2. **Workflow Changes**
- `submitEmbeddedForm()` now shows confirmation modal instead of submitting directly
- `showConfirmationSummary()` prepares all data for display
- `confirmAndSubmit()` handles actual submission after user confirmation
- `cancelConfirmation()` closes modal without submitting

### 3. **Confirmation Modal UI**

#### Modal Sections:

**Work Order Information**
- Work Order Number
- Part Number
- Description

**Batch Details**
- Quantity (with badge)
- Category (New/Used with color-coded badges)
- Customer Type

**Serial Number Assignments Table**
- Row number
- EyeFi Serial Number
- UL Number
- UL Category

**Assets to be Generated/Created Table**
- Row number
- Asset Number (or "Will be generated on submit")
- EyeFi Serial
- UL Number

**Warning Alert**
- Clear message about database changes
- Mentions serial consumption

#### Modal Actions:
- ✅ **Confirm & Submit** - Proceeds with asset generation and database updates
- ❌ **Cancel** - Closes modal and returns to form

### 4. **Styling Features**
- Professional modal design with shadow effects
- Color-coded badges for categories (Green = New, Blue = Used)
- Responsive tables with hover effects
- Smooth fade-in animations
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Maximum height with scrollable content
- Bootstrap 5 styling

### 5. **Data Handling**
- Handles both string and object serial formats
- Displays appropriate data for NEW vs USED categories
- Shows preview for IGT pre-selected assets
- Shows "(Will be generated on submit)" for SG/AGS assets

## User Flow

1. **Step 5**: User clicks "Generate Assets & Submit" button
2. **Modal Opens**: Comprehensive summary displayed
3. **User Reviews**: All information visible in organized sections
4. **User Decides**:
   - **Confirm**: Proceeds with `confirmAndSubmit()` → generates assets → submits to database
   - **Cancel**: Closes modal, returns to form for edits

## Benefits

✅ **Error Prevention**: Users can catch mistakes before database changes
✅ **Transparency**: Complete visibility of what will be created
✅ **User Confidence**: Clear summary builds trust in the system
✅ **Audit Trail**: Users see exactly what they're approving
✅ **Professional UX**: Enterprise-grade confirmation flow
