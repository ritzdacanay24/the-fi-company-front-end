# Deployment Instructions - Protection.php Fix and Authorization Support

## Issue Fixed
The `Protection.php` file had undefined variable `$e` errors on lines 122, 135, and 147 where it was trying to call `$e->getMessage()` outside the scope where `$e` was defined.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Protection.php (`backend/config/Protection.php`)
**Location on server:** `/var/www/html/server/Config/Protection.php`

**Changes:**
- Fixed undefined `$e` variable in the else block when no JWT is extracted (line ~122)
- Fixed undefined `$e` variable in the else block when authorization header is missing (line ~147)
- Renamed inner exception variable from `$e` to `$e2` to avoid confusion (line ~105)
- Added proper error messages for each failure case

**Action Required:** Upload the fixed `backend/config/Protection.php` to the server at `/var/www/html/server/Config/Protection.php`

### 2. Updated get-session.php (`backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php`)
**Changes:**
- Added support for Authorization header
- Added fallback to accept authorization token via query parameter (`?authorization=Bearer xxx`)
- Integrated with Protection class for JWT validation

**How it works:**
```php
// Accepts authorization from:
// 1. HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header (standard)
// 2. Query parameter: ?authorization=Bearer xxx (fallback for scenarios where headers aren't available)

$authHeader = $_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'] ?? $_GET['authorization'] ?? null;
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload Protection.php to server:**
   ```bash
   scp backend/config/Protection.php user@server:/var/www/html/server/Config/Protection.php
   ```

2. **Verify permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /var/www/html/server/Config/Protection.php
   ```

3. **Upload get-session.php to server:**
   ```bash
   scp backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php user@server:/var/www/html/backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php
   ```

4. **Test the endpoint:**
   - With header: `GET https://dashboard.eye-fi.com/backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php?session_id=123`
     - Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - With query param: `GET https://dashboard.eye-fi.com/backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php?session_id=123&authorization=Bearer <token>`

## Frontend Changes
The frontend remains pointed at the original location:
- Angular: `verification-session/get-session.php`
- Tablet Companion: `${API_BASE}/verification-session/get-session.php`

No frontend changes needed as the endpoint location is back to the original path.

## Files to Deploy
1. `backend/config/Protection.php` → `/var/www/html/server/Config/Protection.php`
2. `backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php` → `/var/www/html/backend/api/verification-session/get-session.php`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify Protection.php has no syntax errors
- [ ] Test get-session.php with valid authorization token
- [ ] Test get-session.php without authorization (should get 900 error)
- [ ] Test get-session.php with invalid token (should get 900 error)
- [ ] Verify tablet companion can connect to verification sessions
- [ ] Verify Angular app can retrieve session data
