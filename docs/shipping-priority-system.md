# Shipping Priority System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a priority system to the shipping module, allowing users to set unique priorities on orders to manage shipping sequence effectively.

## Features

### 1. Priority Management
- **Editable Priority Column**: Users can directly edit priority values in the grid
- **Unique Priority Constraint**: No two orders can have the same priority number
- **Visual Indicators**: Priority orders are highlighted with star badges
- **Zero Priority**: Orders with priority 0 or null have no priority (default state)

### 2. Dual Tab System
- **All Orders Tab**: Shows all shipping orders with priority column
- **Priority Orders Tab**: Shows only orders with assigned priorities, sorted by priority (1=highest)
- **Order Counts**: Each tab displays the count of orders

### 3. Real-time Validation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: System prevents assigning duplicate priorities
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users get instant validation messages
- **Auto-revert**: Failed priority updates automatically revert to previous value

## User Workflow

### Setting Priorities
1. Navigate to the shipping module
2. In the "Priority" column, click on a cell to edit
3. Enter a priority number (1 = highest priority)
4. Press Enter to save
5. System validates uniqueness and saves if valid

### Viewing Priority Orders
1. Click on the "Priority Orders" tab
2. View all orders with assigned priorities
3. Orders are automatically sorted by priority (1, 2, 3, etc.)
4. Use this view to manage shipping sequence

### Managing Priority Conflicts
- If you try to assign an existing priority, you'll see an error message
- The system will tell you which order already has that priority
- Choose a different priority number or adjust existing priorities

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add priority column
ALTER TABLE shipping_orders 
ADD COLUMN shipping_priority INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Add unique constraint for non-zero priorities
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_shipping_priority 
ON shipping_orders(shipping_priority) 
WHERE shipping_priority > 0;
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/operations/shipping-priority.php` - Update order priority
- Validates uniqueness and updates database
- Returns success/error with detailed messages

### Frontend Components
- **Priority Column**: Editable number input with validation
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between all orders and priority orders
- **Visual Indicators**: Star badges for priority orders
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate grid refresh after priority changes

## Benefits

### For Operations Team
- **Clear Shipping Sequence**: Priority orders are clearly identified
- **Flexible Priority Management**: Easy to adjust priorities as business needs change
- **No Confusion**: Unique priorities prevent conflicting instructions

### For Management
- **Priority Visibility**: Easy to see which orders are prioritized
- **Quick Overview**: Priority tab shows urgent orders at a glance
- **Audit Trail**: System tracks who set priorities and when

## Business Rules

1. **Priority Numbers**: Use ascending numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **Highest Priority**: Priority 1 is the highest priority
3. **No Duplicates**: Each priority number can only be used once
4. **Zero Priority**: Orders with priority 0 have no special priority
5. **Sorting**: Priority orders are always sorted by priority number

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Rush Order
```
SO1234 gets priority 1 (urgent customer request)
SO1235 gets priority 2 (important client)
SO1236 remains priority 0 (normal processing)
```

### Example 2: Changing Priorities
```
If SO1237 needs to become highest priority:
- Set SO1237 priority to 1
- System will require you to change existing priority 1 order first
- Or use priority 0.5 if you want to insert between existing priorities
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Priority already exists" error**
   - Another order already has that priority
   - Check the Priority Orders tab to see existing priorities
   - Choose a different number or update the conflicting order first

2. **Priority not saving**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages

3. **Orders not appearing in Priority tab**
   - Ensure priority is greater than 0
   - Refresh the page if needed
   - Check that the order was saved successfully

### Support
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify database connectivity
- Ensure proper user permissions for updating orders
