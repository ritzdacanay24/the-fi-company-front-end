# Workflow-Verification Tracking - Implementation Complete! âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration âœ…
**File:** `database/migrations/add_workflow_verification_tracking.sql`

- Added `workflow_session_id` to `serial_assignments` table
- Added `workflow_session_id` to `verification_sessions` table  
- Created new `serial_verification_details` table for per-serial tracking
- Added `verified_in_photo` and `verification_detail_id` to `serial_assignments`

### 2. Angular Frontend Changes âœ…

**File:** `src/app/standalone/eyefi-serial-workflow/eyefi-serial-workflow.component.ts`

- Added `workflowSessionId` property
- Generate UUID on component init: `this.workflowSessionId = this.generateUUID()`
- Pass `workflowSessionId` to verification session creation
- Added `generateUUID()` helper method

**File:** `src/app/features/serial-assignments/services/serial-assignments.service.ts`

- Updated `createVerificationSession()` to accept `workflowSessionId` parameter
- Pass `workflow_session_id` in request body to backend

### 3. Backend API Changes âœ…

**File:** `backend/api/verification-session/create-session.php`

- Accept `workflow_session_id` from request body
- Store it in `verification_sessions` table on INSERT

**File:** `backend/api/verification-session/submit-photo.php`

- Fetch `workflow_session_id` from verification session
- For each new serial match:
  - Insert into `serial_verification_details` table
  - Update matching `serial_assignments` record with:
    - `verified = 1`
    - `verified_in_photo = {photo_number}`
    - `verification_detail_id = {detail_id}`
    - `verification_session_id = {session_id}`

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram:

```
1. User opens workflow component
   â””â”€> Generate workflow_session_id: "abc-123-def"

2. User adds serials (Step 3)
   â””â”€> serial_assignments:
       - id: 1, serial: "147241", workflow_session_id: "abc-123-def"
       - id: 2, serial: "147242", workflow_session_id: "abc-123-def"
       - id: 3, serial: "147243", workflow_session_id: "abc-123-def"

3. User starts verification (Step 4)
   â””â”€> Create verification session:
       verification_sessions:
         - id: "xyz-789"
         - workflow_session_id: "abc-123-def"
         - expected_serials: ["147241", "147242", "147243"]

4. Tablet captures Photo 1 (finds 147241, 147242)
   â””â”€> submit-photo.php processes:
       
       serial_verification_details:
         - id: 1, session: "xyz-789", serial: "147241", type: "eyefi", photo: 1
         - id: 2, session: "xyz-789", serial: "147242", type: "eyefi", photo: 1
       
       serial_assignments:
         - id: 1, verified: 1, verified_in_photo: 1, verification_detail_id: 1 âœ“
         - id: 2, verified: 1, verified_in_photo: 1, verification_detail_id: 2 âœ“
         - id: 3, verified: 0, verified_in_photo: NULL (still pending)

5. Tablet captures Photo 2 (finds 147243)
   â””â”€> submit-photo.php processes:
       
       serial_verification_details:
         - id: 3, session: "xyz-789", serial: "147243", type: "eyefi", photo: 2
       
       serial_assignments:
         - id: 3, verified: 1, verified_in_photo: 2, verification_detail_id: 3 âœ“
       
       verification_sessions:
         - match_result: "complete"
         - session_status: "completed"
```

## Benefits

### âœ… Complete Audit Trail
- Know exactly which serial was verified in which photo
- Track who verified (tablet) and when (captured_at)
- Full history in `serial_verification_details`

### âœ… Per-Serial UI Display
Can now show in UI:
```
147241 âœ“ Verified (Photo 1 at 14:30:01)
147242 âœ“ Verified (Photo 1 at 14:30:01)
147243 âœ“ Verified (Photo 2 at 14:30:15)
```

### âœ… Prevent Duplicates
- Check if `workflow_session_id` already has completed verification
- Resume partial verifications

### âœ… Link Everything Together
- Workflow â†’ Serial Assignments â†’ Verification Session â†’ Verification Details
- Complete traceability

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Migration (REQUIRED)
```sql
-- Run on your database:
source database/migrations/add_workflow_verification_tracking.sql;
```

### 2. Deploy Files to Server
- `backend/api/verification-session/create-session.php`
- `backend/api/verification-session/submit-photo.php`

### 3. Test End-to-End
1. Start new workflow (generates workflow_session_id)
2. Add 3 serials in Step 3
3. Start verification in Step 4
4. Capture photos on tablet
5. Watch `serial_assignments` table update with `verified=1` and `verified_in_photo`

### 4. (Optional) Update UI to Show Per-Serial Status
```html
<tr *ngFor="let assignment of serialAssignments">
  <td>{{ assignment.serial?.serial_number }}</td>
  <td>
    <span *ngIf="assignment.verified" class="badge badge-success">
      âœ“ Verified (Photo {{ assignment.verified_in_photo }})
    </span>
    <span *ngIf="!assignment.verified" class="badge badge-warning">
      Pending
    </span>
  </td>
</tr>
```

## Database Schema Reference

### serial_assignments
- `workflow_session_id` VARCHAR(36) - Links all serials in workflow batch
- `verified_in_photo` INT - Which photo number verified this
- `verification_detail_id` INT - FK to serial_verification_details

### verification_sessions  
- `workflow_session_id` VARCHAR(36) - Links back to workflow

### serial_verification_details (NEW)
- `verification_session_id` VARCHAR(36) - FK to verification_sessions
- `serial_number` VARCHAR(50) - The actual serial verified
- `serial_type` ENUM('eyefi', 'ul') - Type of serial
- `photo_number` INT - Which photo captured this (1, 2, 3...)
- `captured_at` TIMESTAMP - When verified
- `verified_by` VARCHAR(100) - Who verified

## Testing Queries

```sql
-- See all verifications for a workflow
SELECT 
    sa.eyefi_serial_number,
    sa.ul_number,
    sa.verified,
    sa.verified_in_photo,
    svd.photo_number,
    svd.captured_at,
    svd.verified_by
FROM serial_assignments sa
LEFT JOIN serial_verification_details svd ON sa.verification_detail_id = svd.id
WHERE sa.workflow_session_id = 'abc-123-def';

-- See all serials verified in a specific session
SELECT * FROM serial_verification_details
WHERE verification_session_id = 'xyz-789'
ORDER BY photo_number, captured_at;
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Implementation Complete!** Now you have full traceability of which serial was verified in which photo!
