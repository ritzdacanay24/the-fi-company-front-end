# EyeFi Serial Search Component - Display Mismatch Fix

## Issue Identified
The EyeFi serial search component was displaying a "selected" state (green badge with "Available") even when the typed serial number didn't exist in the database.

### Example of the Bug:
- User types "eyefi-00722" (which doesn't exist)
- Component shows green success alert with "eyefi-007" (a different, valid serial)
- This created confusion about which serial was actually selected

### Root Cause:
When a user:
1. Selected a valid serial from the dropdown (e.g., "eyefi-007")
2. Then continued typing to modify it (e.g., "eyefi-00722")
3. The `selectedSerial` object remained set to the previous selection
4. The component displayed both:
   - The typed value in the input: "eyefi-00722"
   - The old selection in the success alert: "eyefi-007" with "Available" badge

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Clear Selection on Value Change
Updated `onSearchChange()` method to clear `selectedSerial` when the typed value doesn't match:

```typescript
onSearchChange(event: any): void {
  const value = event.target.value;
  this.searchTerm = value;
  
  // Clear selection if search term doesn't match selected serial
  if (this.selectedSerial && value !== this.selectedSerial.serial_number) {
    this.selectedSerial = null;
  }
  
  // ... rest of method
}
```

**What this does:**
- Continuously checks if typed value matches the selected serial
- Immediately clears the selection if they don't match
- Removes the green "Available" badge display
- Shows the search state instead of selected state

### 2. Non-Strict Mode Behavior Update
Fixed non-strict mode to not auto-emit on typing:

```typescript
if (!this.strictMode) {
  // Non-strict mode: clear selected serial to show search state
  // Don't emit until user selects from dropdown or leaves the field
  if (!value) {
    this.notifyParent.emit(null);
  }
  // Show dropdown suggestions
  this.searchSubject.next(value);
}
```

**What changed:**
- Removed immediate emission on every keystroke
- Only emits when field is cleared or on blur event
- Prevents false "validated" state for non-existent serials

### 3. Manual Entry on Blur
Added logic to handle manual entry when user leaves the field:

```typescript
onBlur(): void {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.showDropdown = false;
    
    // In non-strict mode, if user typed something but didn't select from dropdown,
    // emit it as a manual entry
    if (!this.strictMode && this.searchTerm && !this.selectedSerial) {
      this.notifyParent.emit({ 
        serial_number: this.searchTerm,
        isManualEntry: true // Flag to indicate this is manual entry, not validated
      });
    }
  }, 200);
}
```

**What this does:**
- Waits for user to leave the field
- Checks if there's a typed value but no database selection
- Emits with `isManualEntry: true` flag to distinguish from validated entries

## User Experience After Fix

### Strict Mode (Validated Only):
1. User types "eyefi-00722"
2. Search runs, finds no results
3. Shows "No EyeFi Serial Numbers Found" message with blue alert
4. NO green badge or "selected" display appears
5. Form cannot be submitted without a valid selection

### Non-Strict Mode (Allows Manual Entry):
1. User types "eyefi-00722"
2. Search runs, finds no results
3. Shows "No EyeFi Serial Numbers Found" message with green alert
4. Message says: "Not an EyeFi device? That's okay! You can still use 'eyefi-00722' as a manual entry"
5. NO green badge appears while typing
6. When user moves to next field (blur), value is emitted with `isManualEntry: true`
7. Parent form can use this value as a manual entry

### Valid Selection Flow:
1. User types "eyefi-00"
2. Dropdown shows matching serials (e.g., "eyefi-007", "eyefi-008")
3. User clicks "eyefi-007"
4. Green success alert appears with "Available" badge
5. If user then types "2" to change it to "eyefi-0072"
6. Green alert immediately disappears (selection cleared)
7. Search runs again for "eyefi-0072"

## Files Modified

### eyefi-serial-search.component.ts
- **Line 57-59**: Added selection clearing logic on value change
- **Line 65-74**: Updated non-strict mode to not auto-emit
- **Line 159-167**: Enhanced onBlur to emit manual entries with flag

## Testing Scenarios

✅ **Scenario 1: Type non-existent serial**
- Type "eyefi-99999"
- ✓ Shows "not found" message
- ✓ NO green badge appears
- ✓ Selection remains null

✅ **Scenario 2: Select then modify**
- Select "eyefi-007" from dropdown
- ✓ Green badge shows "Available"
- Type "2" to make "eyefi-0072"
- ✓ Green badge immediately disappears
- ✓ Search runs for new value

✅ **Scenario 3: Non-strict manual entry**
- StrictMode = false
- Type "CUSTOM-123"
- ✓ Shows "not found" with green "okay to use" message
- Move to next field
- ✓ Emits { serial_number: "CUSTOM-123", isManualEntry: true }

✅ **Scenario 4: Valid selection**
- Type "eyefi-007"
- Click on "eyefi-007" from dropdown
- ✓ Green badge shows with device details
- ✓ Emits full serial object with status, model, etc.

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Confusion**: No more mismatched displays between input and selection
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Selection badge only appears for validated database records
3. **Proper Manual Entry**: Non-strict mode clearly distinguishes manual vs validated entries
4. **Better UX**: Immediate clearing of selection when user modifies the value
5. **Data Integrity**: Parent forms can trust the `isManualEntry` flag for validation logic
