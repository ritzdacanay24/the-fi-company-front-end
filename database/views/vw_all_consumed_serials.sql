-- ========================================
-- Comprehensive View: All Consumed Serial Numbers
-- ========================================
-- Purpose: UNION all consumed/used serial numbers from all sources
-- Sources:
--   1. serial_assignments (new system - includes UL labels)
--   2. agsSerialGenerator (legacy) - EXCLUDED if already in serial_assignments
--   3. sgAssetGenerator (legacy) - EXCLUDED if already in serial_assignments
--   4. igt_serial_numbers (only 'used' status)
--
-- Deduplication Strategy:
--   - During transition, same serial may exist in both new and legacy tables
--   - Legacy records are excluded if serial already exists in serial_assignments
--   - This prevents duplicates without complex queries
-- ========================================
-- Note: Run this in the eyefidb database

-- ========================================

-- Example 1: Get all consumed serials (paginated)
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials LIMIT 50;

-- Example 2: Get summary by source
-- SELECT * FROM vw_consumed_serials_summary;

-- Example 3: Search for specific serial number across all sources
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE eyefi_serial_number LIKE '%147207%' 
--    OR ul_number LIKE '%T75097256%'
--    OR igt_serial_number LIKE '%IGT%'
--    OR ags_serial_number LIKE '%AGS%'
--    OR sg_asset_number LIKE '%SG%';

-- Example 4: Get all serials for a specific work order
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE wo_number = '40745' OR po_number = '40745';

-- Example 5: Get all serials consumed by a specific user
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE used_by = 'Richard Hernandez'
-- ORDER BY used_date DESC;

-- Example 6: Get consumption trend for last 30 days
-- SELECT * FROM vw_daily_consumption_trend;

-- Example 7: Get user activity summary
-- SELECT * FROM vw_user_consumption_activity;

-- Example 8: Get serials consumed today
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE DATE(used_date) = CURDATE()
-- ORDER BY used_date DESC;

-- Example 9: Get serials by source type
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE source_table = 'serial_assignments'
-- ORDER BY used_date DESC;

-- Example 10: Get voided assignments (from new system only)
-- SELECT * FROM vw_all_consumed_serials 
-- WHERE source_table = 'serial_assignments' AND is_voided = 1;

-- Notes
-- ========================================
-- 1. This view consolidates ALL consumed/used serials from all sources
-- 2. Each record has a unique_id prefix to identify the source
-- 3. Only active/non-voided records are included (except voided can be filtered)
-- 4. IGT serials are included ONLY if status = 'used'
-- 5. Legacy tables (ags, sg, ul_label_usages) only include active records
-- 6. Serial_assignments includes only non-voided records
-- 7. All dates are normalized to 'used_date' for consistency
-- 8. All users are normalized to 'used_by' for consistency
-- 9. Work orders from both 'wo_number' and 'po_number' columns
-- 10. Supports full-text search across all serial types
